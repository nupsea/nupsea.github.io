Welcome to my personal portfolio and blog.

I am a **Senior Data Platform Engineer** passionate about building reliable, observable, and scalable data systems. Over the years, I've worked extensively with technologies like **Apache Flink, Spark, Kafka, and Airflow**.

Recently, I've been experimenting with **Generative AI**, specifically focusing on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic workflows.

## What to expect here?

I plan to use this space to document my learning and share projects related to:

*   **Real-time Data Processing**: Insights from building streaming pipelines.
*   **Reliability & Observability**: Best practices for maintaining healthy data platforms.
*   **GenAI Experiments**: Demos and breakdowns of my projects like *Book-Mate* and *Content-Pal*.

Check out my [Projects](/projects) page to see what I've been working on.
